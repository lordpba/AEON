# 🚀 AEON - Autonomous Governance System for Space Colonies

![AEON Banner](city_mars_prototype.jpeg)

## 🌟 Overview

**AEON** (Autonomous Environment Operations Network) is an AI-powered simulation framework for managing isolated human communities in space. Inspired by a sci-fi novel, this project combines cutting-edge AI governance with realistic simulation mechanics to create both a research tool and an interactive "game" experience.

### Key Features

- 🤖 **AI-Driven Governance** - Autonomous decision-making systems
- 🌊 **Resource Management** - Track water, food, energy, oxygen, and materials
- 🔧 **System Maintenance** - Realistic degradation and repair mechanics
- ⚕️ **Health Monitoring** - Physical and psychological wellbeing tracking
- ⚖️ **Conflict Resolution** - Democratic governance and policy management
- 🎲 **Dynamic Events** - Solar storms, equipment failures, discoveries
- 📊 **Interactive Dashboard** - Real-time visualization and control
- 💾 **Save/Load System** - Persistent simulation states

## 🎯 Project Goals

1. Create a realistic simulation of autonomous colony management
2. Research AI governance systems for isolated habitats
3. Develop a framework that's both scientifically rigorous and engaging
4. Provide a testbed for decision-making algorithms
5. Inspire future space colonization efforts

## 📦 Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- pip package manager
- (Optional) Node.js for DAO components

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/lordpba/AEON.git
cd AEON
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Run the simulation**

**Option A: Command-line simulation**
```bash
cd code
python aeon_simulator.py
```

**Option B: Interactive dashboard** (Recommended)
```bash
cd code
streamlit run dashboard.py
```

The dashboard will open in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`

## 🎮 How to Use

### Dashboard Interface

1. **Configure Your Colony**
   - Set colony name, population, and simulation speed
   - Click "Start Simulation"

2. **Monitor Status**
   - **Overview Tab**: General statistics and trends
   - **Resources Tab**: Water, food, energy levels with forecasting
   - **Systems Tab**: Infrastructure health and maintenance queue
   - **Health & Society Tab**: Population wellbeing and conflicts
   - **Events & Log Tab**: History of events and crises

3. **Interact with the Colony**
   - Pause/Resume simulation
   - Adjust time scale (0.1x to 100x speed)
   - Perform manual repairs
   - Resolve conflicts
   - Save simulation state

### Command-Line Simulation

```python
from aeon_simulator import AEONColonySimulator
from config import ColonyConfig

# Create custom configuration
config = ColonyConfig(
    name="Mars Base Alpha",
    population_size=100,
    time_scale=10.0  # 10x speed
)

# Initialize and start
simulator = AEONColonySimulator(config)
simulator.start()

# Get status
print(simulator.get_summary())

# Save state
simulator.save_state("my_colony.json")
```
