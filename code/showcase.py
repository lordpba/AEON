AEON aims to be more than a game or simulation—it's a testbed for the
future of human civilization beyond Earth. By combining:

  • Realistic physics and engineering
  • Advanced AI decision-making
  • Democratic governance mechanisms
  • Engaging gameplay

...we create a platform that can both entertain and contribute to real
research on how humanity can thrive in space.

The ultimate goal: When humans establish their first Mars colony, AEON's
lessons and algorithms could help manage it.
