Notes:
User Interface: The user_interface method simulates a simple command-line interface for human operators. In a real system, this would be a GUI or possibly integrated into a larger control center interface.
Override Mechanisms: Here, overrides are simulated with simple input/output. In a real system, overrides would involve complex interactions with other systems, possibly requiring authentication, and would need to ensure safety and integrity of the autonomous processes.
Monitoring: The monitor_for_intervention method randomly decides if intervention is needed for simulation. In an actual setup, this would involve monitoring real-time data from other modules, looking for anomalies or conditions requiring manual intervention.
Emergency Actions: The emergency_stop function is a placeholder. In a real-world scenario, this would involve detailed procedures to safely shut down or pause autonomous operations, potentially with multiple levels of confirmation to prevent accidental activation.
Security: Real implementations would require robust security measures to prevent unauthorized access to these control mechanisms, including user authentication, session management, and possibly physical security measures.

This module provides a framework for human oversight in an autonomous system, allowing for manual intervention when necessary, which is critical for systems where human judgment might be needed or where autonomous decisions could have significant impacts.
