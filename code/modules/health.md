Notes:
Data Simulation: The health metrics are randomly generated for demonstration. In an actual system, these would be real-time data from medical sensors, patient reports, or other monitoring systems.
Interventions: The intervention methods (plan_medical_intervention, plan_mental_health_support) are placeholders where you would implement actual actions like scheduling medical consultations or sending alerts.
Privacy and Ethics: In a real-world scenario, handling health data would require strict adherence to privacy laws and ethical guidelines. This code assumes an ideal scenario where consent for monitoring has been granted.
Scalability: The module assumes a small population for simplicity. For scalability, consider using databases or more efficient data structures for storing and analyzing data.

This structure provides a basic model for health monitoring that can be expanded or integrated with other systems in your autonomous governance framework.
