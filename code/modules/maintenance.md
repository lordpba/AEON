Module Structure
The maintenance.py module is designed to handle preventive maintenance, anomaly diagnosis, and maintenance planning for critical systems in a Mars colony. Its basic structure includes:

Imports: Uses threading for parallel execution, time for periodic checking, and typing for defining function return types, making the code more readable and less error-prone.
Class MaintenanceAndRepairs: This is the main class that manages all maintenance operations.

Class Functionality
Initialization (__init__ method):
self.system_health: A dictionary that represents the health status of various critical systems in the colony. Initially, all systems are considered operational (True).
self.lock: A locking mechanism to ensure that critical operations are not interrupted or that data is not overwritten by concurrent threads.
Method run:
Designed to run in a separate thread, it continuously monitors, diagnoses, and plans maintenance in an infinite loop, sleeping for a minute between cycles.
Method preventive_monitoring:
Simulates a preventive check on all systems. It uses locking to ensure only one thread at a time can access or modify self.system_health.
Through the _simulate_system_check method, it simulates checking each system but in reality, it always returns True for simplicity. In a real application, actual diagnostic checks would be implemented here.
Method _simulate_system_check:
A support method (private, as indicated by the _ prefix) that simulates checking a specific system. Currently, it always returns True indicating the system is OK, but in a real context, this is where actual system checks would occur.

Module Goals
Preventive Maintenance: Through continuous monitoring, the goal is to identify potential issues before they become critical, reducing the risk of unexpected failures.
Anomaly Diagnosis: Although the diagnose_anomalies method isn't implemented in the example, the idea is that
