Notes:
Conflict Detection: The detect_conflicts method simulates conflict detection. In reality, this would involve integrating with sources of social data or direct user input.
Resolution: Conflict resolution is simplified with a random chance of success. Real-world implementations would involve negotiation algorithms, mediation, or arbitration.
Policy Making: The political_decision_making method uses random choice for simulation. A real system might use AI to analyze data, community feedback, or incorporate expert systems for policy decisions.
Democratic Participation: This module simulates participation. An actual implementation might involve voting systems, forums, or other mechanisms for citizens to engage with governance.
Data Structures: Lists and dictionaries are used for simplicity. In a production environment, consider using databases for persistence, scalability, and better data management.
Ethics and Transparency: In practice, ensuring transparency in conflict management, policy decisions, and democratic processes is crucial. This would include mechanisms for appeals, rights to information, and protections against manipulation.

This module provides a framework for managing societal interactions in an autonomous system, which can be expanded with more detailed algorithms and integration with other modules like resource management or human supervision for a comprehensive governance solution.
